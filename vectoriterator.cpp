/*An iterator is an object that allows you to traverse (go through) the elements of a container (like a list, array, vector, etc.)
 one by one, without exposing the underlying structure of the container.

In simple terms:
Think of an iterator like a bookmark or a pointer that helps you move from one item to the next in a collection.

You're declaring a variable named it.

This variable is of type vector<int>::iterator, which means:

It is an iterator that can move through a vector<int>.

It behaves like a pointer to elements inside the vector.

Breaking it down:
vector<int>: A vector that holds int values.

vector<int>::iterator: A special type defined by the vector to iterate over its elements.

it: The iterator variable you're declaring.
