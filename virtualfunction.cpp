/*üß† What You Expect:
You probably want the program to print:

I'm eating cat food.
Because ptr is pointing to a Cat object.

‚ùå What Actually Happens:
It will print:

I'm eating generic food.
That‚Äôs because in C++, function overriding works polymorphically only when the base class function is marked virtual.

‚úÖ Fix:
In your Animal class, change:

void eat() {
    cout << "I'm eating generic food.";
}
To:

virtual void eat() {
    cout << "I'm eating generic food.";
}
This tells the compiler: ‚ÄúIf this function is overridden in a derived class, call the derived version at runtime (not the base one).‚Äù

‚úÖ After Fixing:
With virtual added, now when you call function1(ptr) where ptr points to a Cat or Dog, the correct eat() function is called based on the actual object type.*/
